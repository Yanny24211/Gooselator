This project was designed and created by Yanny Patel, Tom Croux, Tim Rozer, and Krish Patel! (AKA Team Goose) 

A Translator built to translate English words into 3 different indigenous languages and vice versa 

This project was made for Ryerson's (TMU) annual engineering competition, the theme of that year was to build a device to aid in communication and the aspects of the medicine wheel had to also be incorporated. Our group decided on building a translator with a library of 20 words which could be translated from English to Cree, Ojibway and Mohawk. The Translator could also allow the user to add more words to the existing library of the translator, allowing to have more translations availible for future use. 

We used HTML5 and CSS for the frontend of the website while JS was used for the backend of the website. 

To make the bot even more accesible, We also designed a discord bot using python which allowed for users to translate words using a discord bot and certain commands. 

This project was made in a time span of 24 Hours
